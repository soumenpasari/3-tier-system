<span class="text-info">Name of the project</span>
<h4 class="text-success">Three Tier System <span class="text-secondary">(3-T-S)</span></h4>
<p>
  The whole project is all for research purpose only and a work of college students for their final year engineering project.
</p>
<p>
  The whole idea is to create or design a sytem or computer environment based on
  <mark>three tier architecture</mark> on which simple functions or program form client side will be
  processed by the secondary or main server i.e; the first server that interacts with the user and will return
  the results to the user and if the query or request from the user is of big data query then the main server or secondary server
  will request the the third system in this architecture i.e; the big data server and the that server will process the
  required query and return the result to the main server and the main server later will
  return the result to user or client side.
</p>
<p>
  For big data functions we use the <mark>Hadoop</mark> for the query in the beginning, but the thing that we are researching
  on is to create a similar file system like <mark>HDFS</mark> that is used by <mark>Hadoop</mark> and after that we will
  analyse the time difference and all the differences or report that we get from the famous Hadoop and our own file system
  and will compare it later.

<p>
  This project is a result of final year project at <mark>Netaji Subhash Engineering College</mark> by students of department
  <mark>Information Technology</mark> 4<sup>th</sup> Year under the guidance of <mark>Prof. Anirban Kundu</mark>.
